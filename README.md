# Wendys

App developed using the API [GetMenuSite](https://api.app.tst.wendys.digital/web-client-gateway/menu/getSiteMenu?lang=en&cntry=US&sourceCode=ORDER.WENDYS&version=22.1.2&siteNum=0).

## Description

This challenge was designed to be able to assess some knowledge that we consider
crucial in the day-to-day life of a mobile engineer within Navalia. The code test
consists of creating an application that simulates a menu of items and adding these
items to a shopping cart.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase by separating concerns and adhering to best practices.
- **Get It**: A simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects to manage dependencies.
- **Flutter BLoC**: A predictable state management library that helps implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern.
